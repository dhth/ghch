`ghx` provides an alternative to GitHub's UI for viewing commit logs between
git tags.

ü§î Why does this exist?
---

I often need to view commit logs between two git tags for GitHub hosted
repositories. While GitHub's UI allows comparing refs, doing it for git tags is
a bit tedious. Additionally, comparing tags for multiple repositories involves a
lot of clicks. To simplify this process, I built `ghx`.

Everything that `ghx` does can be achieved locally using `git`; the goal is to
access commit logs quickly without having to clone a repository, or pull
changes, or run `git tag` to discover tags.

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

```text
$ ghx serve -h
Serve ghx's web interface

  -o, --owner <STRING>       Owner to show results for
  -t, --owner-type <STRING>  Owner type [default: user] [possible values: user, org]

üîë Authentication
---

You can have `ghx` make authenticated calls to GitHub on your behalf in either
of two ways:

- Have an authenticated instance of [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) available
  in your `PATH` (recommended).
- Provide a valid Github token via the environment variable `GH_TOKEN`
